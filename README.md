# MemoryManagement
This Java project with JavaFX aims to implement paging algorithms such as FIFO, SC, MRU, and RND, comparing the results with the optimal algorithm. The application allows simulating memory management with different algorithms and analyzing their performance.

## Description

The project consists of a Java application with a graphical interface developed with JavaFX. The application allows selecting between various paging algorithms and comparing their performance with the optimal algorithm. A file with paging instructions can be loaded to simulate the behavior of the algorithms.
